"# Test-Assessment" 

This source code contains following features

1. Basic in-memory authentication 
2. Crud operations with spring boot (with proper validations and proper error messages)
3. Redis cache for getting details faster
4. Unit test for feature

Improvements needed

1. Added caching mechanism for all customers. Caching should be provided only for frequently visiting customers
2. Provide a different mechanism instead of in-memory authentication
